**Project Title: Chat with URL - A LangChain-Powered Conversational AI**

**Description**

This project combines the power of LangChain with Streamlit to create a conversational AI that can extract information from a given website and engage in meaningful dialogues with users. Users can provide a website URL, and the system will  process the content enabling the AI to provide informed responses to questions about the site.  

**Key Features**

* **Website Contextualization:** Leverages LangChain's retrieval capabilities to analyze provided website content, building a knowledge base for the AI to draw upon.
* **Conversational AI:** Uses sophisticated language models (like Google Gemini or OpenAI) to generate fluent and informative responses.
* **Streamlit Integration:** Provides an intuitive, web-based user interface powered by Streamlit.
* **Flexible LLM Choice:** Supports both Google Gemini and OpenAI language models.

**Technologies**

* **LangChain:** The central framework for constructing and orchestrating the AI's capabilities. ([https://langchain.readthedocs.io](https://langchain.readthedocs.io))
* **Streamlit:**  Creates the dynamic and user-friendly web application interface. ([https://streamlit.io/](https://streamlit.io/))
* **Chroma Vectorstore:** Facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings. ([[https://www.trychroma.com/]]([https://www.trychroma.com/]))
* **Google Gemini  or ChatOpenAI:** The core language models powering the AI's responses.

**Prerequisites**

* Python (version 3.7 or later)
* An OpenAI API key (if using ChatOpenAI) [https://openai.com/api/](https://openai.com/api/)
* Google Cloud Project, Google Gemini API enabled, and any necessary credentials (if using Gemini)

**Installation**

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain chroma openai  # For OpenAI option
pip install streamlit langchain chroma langchain-google-genai  # For Google Gemini option
```

**Usage**

1. **Set Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and store your LLM API keys as follows:

   For OpenAI:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_OpenAI_key>
   ```

   For Google Gemini:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_GEMINI_api_key>
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```
3. **Access the application** in your web browser,  typically at http://localhost:8501.
4. **Provide a website URL** and start your conversation with the AI!

**Customization**

* **Language Models:** Experiment with different language models from providers like Google AI or OpenAI to  tailor the AI's conversational style and capabilities.
* **Vectorstores:** Explore alternate vector stores that might better suit your dataset.
